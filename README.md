# Netflix Stock Analysis & Prediction

This project explores and analyzes Netflix (NFLX) stock data and builds a predictive machine learning model to forecast future prices based on historical trends. The project is implemented in Python using data science and machine learning libraries.

---


## 🧾 Project Structure

- **`NFLX.csv`** – Historical stock data for Netflix Inc.
- **`ragamaie_data analasis.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook with complete data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **`random_model.pkl`** – A serialized machine learning model trained to predict stock price metrics based on historical data.

---


## 🧠 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and pattern visualization
- Feature engineering for stock prediction
- Training a regression-based ML model
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Saving and loading the model with `joblib`

---


## 📦 Requirements

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Typical dependencies include:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- joblib  
- jupyter
---


## 📊 Model Details

The model is based on **Random Forest Regressor**, chosen for its robustness in handling non-linear relationships and noisy data.

Features used for prediction include:

- Historical Open, High, Low, Close prices  
- Volume traded  
- Engineered features like moving averages, RSI, or other technical indicators (see notebook for details)  

---


## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)  

These metrics help quantify the prediction accuracy and provide insight into how well the model fits the historical data.

## 🚀 How to Use

Follow these steps to run the analysis and use the trained model:

1.**Clone this repository to your local machine:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ragamaie-Nagineni/model-of-stock-data.git
   cd model-of-stock-data
   ```
   
2.**Install Required Libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib jupyter
 ```

3.**Open the Notebook**

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the file ragamaie_data analasis.ipynb.

4.**Run the Notebook**

- Step through each cell to:
- Load and visualize the stock data
- Preprocess and engineer features
- Train a machine learning model
- Evaluate model performance
- Save the model as random_model.pkl
  
  
5.**Use the trained model**

```bash
import joblib

# Load the saved model
model = joblib.load('random_model.pkl')

# Predict using input features (replace with actual values)
prediction = model.predict([[<your_input_features>]])
print("Predicted value:", prediction)
```


## 📊 Example Use Case

This model can be adapted for:

- Predicting stock closing prices  
- Analyzing moving averages and trends  
- Supporting financial decision-making tools

## 📌 Notes

- This project is for educational and illustrative purposes only.  
- It should **not** be used for actual investment or trading decisions.  
- The model's accuracy depends heavily on the quality of data and feature engineering.  
- Further tuning, validation, and testing are strongly recommended before practical deployment.
